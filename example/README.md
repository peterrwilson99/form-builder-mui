## Usage

### Builder

The builder interface allows you to select elements to add to the page from the '+' button. You can customize the properties of each component by clicking on the settings icon. Components can be rearranged using the up and down arrows, and they can be deleted using the delete icon.

The viewer interface displays the created form. You can interact with the form inputs, select options, and submit the form. The submitted form data can be handled in the `handleSubmit` function.
